# Automated-Machine-Failure-Detection
A time series analysis attempt to detect different modes in which the machine operates (normal, faulty and failure state). 

- The main objective is to find when the machine transitions from normal state to faulty state. 

- Used rolling statistics approach and Chauvenetâ€™s Criterion to detect the states of the machine. 

- Incorporated data cleaning, exploratory data analysis and data modeling techniques for time series data
